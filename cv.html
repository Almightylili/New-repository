                    <p>
                        Zhuoyu Zhang (she/they) is a new media artist who graduated with a BFA in Visual Communication from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and is pursuing an MFA in Design & Technology at Parsons School of Design. As a Gen Z artist under the Internet age, Zhuoyu navigates the complexities of digital culture. Immersed in a constant flow of viewpoints and narratives, she uses dynamic imagery, 3D modeling, and mixed media to critically analyze the intersection of past traumas and current societal challenges. Integrating theory and practical knowledge of moving images, Zhuoyuâ€™s works are presented as video installations that invite intimate experiences with the audience.
